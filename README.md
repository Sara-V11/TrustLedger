##  Overview

Fraud detection systems in banking typically treat transactions as **independent events**, missing patterns of **coordinated fraud** among users.  
**TrustLedger** takes a **network-based approach**, representing transactions as a **graph** to reveal hidden relationships and detect fraud rings.

Each **node** represents an account, and each **edge** represents a transaction between accounts.  
By applying **Graph Neural Networks (GNNs)**, the model learns to detect suspicious accounts based on both **node features** and **edge features** (e.g., transaction amount and timing).

##  Dataset

The dataset consists of **6.3 million** financial transactions between customers.  
For faster experimentation, **50,000 transactions** were sampled.

### Key Columns:
| Column | Description |
|---------|--------------|
| `step` | Time step of the transaction |
| `type` | Transaction type (e.g., CASH_OUT, TRANSFER) |
| `amount` | Amount of money transferred |
| `nameOrig`, `nameDest` | Sender and receiver accounts |
| `isFraud` | 1 if fraudulent, 0 otherwise |

---

## How It Works

### **1Ô∏è‚É£ Data Preprocessing**
- Encoded sender (`nameOrig`) and receiver (`nameDest`) accounts as numeric IDs.  
- Normalized numerical features (`amount`, `step`).  
- Created additional **node-level features**:
  - Degree
  - In-degree
  - Out-degree
  - Total transaction amount

### ** Graph Construction**
Each transaction was modeled as an edge:
```python
edge_index: [2, 50000]
edge_attr:  [50000, 2]

Node features matrix (x) and labels (y) were created to classify whether an account was fraudulent (1) or legitimate (0).

## Model Architecture

The model uses Edge-feature-aware Graph Convolution via NNConv (from PyTorch Geometric):
Input: Node and edge features

Layers: 2 NNConv layers + 1 Linear layer

Loss Function: Weighted CrossEntropy (to handle class imbalance)

Optimizer: Adam (learning rate = 0.01)
